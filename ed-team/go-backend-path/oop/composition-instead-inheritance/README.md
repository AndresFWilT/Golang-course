# Composition instead Inheritance

Inheritance bad implemented can be a problem. Having that in mind, Go has **Composition**

## Composition

Composition as relations:

- has
- uses

Both relations are 1 to many.

It does not have hierarchy, but we can implement Single Responsibility Principle, and Independency Injection.
We can implement polymorphism media **interfaces**. It's so simple to create unit tests.
