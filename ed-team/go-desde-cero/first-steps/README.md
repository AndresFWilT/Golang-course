# Go From Zero

## Introduction

Go is a language created by Google in 2007 (Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson). Was first released in 2009, want to combine the security and performance from the compiled languages.
The syntaxis is from c, imports and declarations from obenon and pascal, and concurrency from csp.

From the beginning Go was imagined to use concurrency.

Go is a compiled language, is faster in execution time. The compiler is really fast and uses cross-compiling which means that can be compiled in different OS. It's statically typed (safe typed) but is also a dynamic language. It's alo a language really fast to learn (we shall see).
